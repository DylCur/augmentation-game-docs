* Weapons
** Main ideas before beginning to design weapons
   This world is a dystopian future world
   - This means that something like an AK-47 or a standard assault weapon is unrealistic
     They are only suitable when they are being used by underfunded groups (i.e. the rebels)
   
   - Human rights are not a high priority therefore cruel killing methods are perfectly legal
     This also means that biological weapons are legal

     The world is technologically advanced (In lore, they have a dyston sphere)
   - This means that energy isn't expensive
     This then means that when designing weapons, they should be more energy weapons and less bullet based weapons
     The ONLY group allowed to use standard guns are the rebels
  
** Overview of the main ideas
   Cruel weapons are allowed
   Never use bullet weapons unless it is for the rebels
   Energy is cheap so prioritise energy weapons

** The weapons
*** Ranged

**** Ammo
     
     Pistol bullets:
     - The only standard bullets in the game
       They are incredibly weak and innacurate

     Plasma bullets:
     - Basic bullets,
       Incredibly hot and radioactive
       Deal standard damage
       Used by the most basic type of police (Like HL2 metrocops)
       They are made from processed light
       They found a way to make light rapidly ionising 
       (Need to do some research into radiation so it is somewhat realistic)

**** Standard
     
     Pistol:
     - This will be the only standard bullet weapon and will be what the player uses first
       It is weak, semi-auto and innacurate
       There is no tech about it,
       It is dusty and ancient
       This must only be used by the rebels or the player
     
     Plasma Pistol:
     - Automatic weapon that will shoot using energy shots
       Very weak,
       Used by the most basic police

**** Powerful

     Plasma Rocket launcher:
     - Slow
     - Powerful
     - Shoots a large slow moving projectile that explodes on impact
     -
