* Sliding
  Sliding involves the player having momentum
  It is a default mechanic but can be upgraded via augmentations
  These augmentations are:
  - Powerful Slide (LA - CH - EG): 
    * Allows your slides to deal damage to enemies
    * When colliding with an enemy, you will damage them
  
  - Longer Slide
    * Allows you to slide for longer before your slide stops
