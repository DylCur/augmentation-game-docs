* Charging overview
  Charging is similar to demoknight from TF2
  You have a charge metre and once it is fully charged, you can charge
  While charging, you can stop by pressing the charge button again
  For each enemy you hit while charging, your damage will increase by 10% (Max: 300%) for the duration of the charge + 5 seconds
  When you begin your charge, all negative debuffs will have their effectivity halved,
  While you are charging, your attack speed is doubled
  Charges take 6 minutes to recharge (By default)

* Upgrades

  Reduced recharge time I, II and III (LA - CH -> EX -> EX - 3S):
  - Each recharge reduction will halve the amount of time required for a recharge
    0 = 360 seconds
    1 = 180 seconds
    2 = 90 seconds
    3 = 45 seconds
  - The intended recharge time is 180 seconds, you are not intended to leave your recharge at level 0
  
  Increased Damage Buff Time I, II, III (LA - EX - MG -> LG -> LG):
  - Increases the length of the post charge damage buff by 2 seconds per level
    0 = 5 seconds
    1 = 7 seconds
    2 = 9 seconds
    3 = 11 seconds
  - This might need nerfing as potential +300% damage for 11 seconds seems ridiculous
  
  Clear Debuffs (LA - CH - MG):
  - Removes the debuffs when starting a charge instead of just halving the effectivity

  Increased Weapon Switch Speed (While Charging) (LA - CH - MG):
  - Reduces the amount of time it takes to switch weapon
  - This is useful as it allows you to hit many enemies with a fast gun
    and then switch to a slightly slower but still powerful gun / shotgun / last prism type weapon
