* Main Ideas
  You are against the world government and are attempting to overthrown them (Need to think about what could happen in a sequal)

* Characters
** Main Character:
   The main character has an augmented arm that can transform into various kitchen equipment
   as they are a chef
** World Government
   - Tyrannical 
   - Abuse augmentations
* Story
** Start
   You begin at home watching the news
   On the news, there is a story that goes in depth about the increased suicide rates because of the augmentations
   This makes you reflect on you augmentations,
   As you need it for your job as a chef, you decide that you cannot get rid of it and the knife is incredibly helpful for safety (Crime ridden city)
** On the way to work
   You have to walk to work while observing augmented drug addics, crying children and vulnerable people
   You see a hit and run into a shop and are forced to jsut walk by it (Car only leaves once youre past it)
** At work
   You make it to the kitchen on time
   You converse with some friends and it is your turn to work at the counter taking orders
   You go to the counter and take some regular orders (1 or 2)
   It is a fancy resteraunt and you get payed a lot
   Suddenly, a scruffy augmented man walks in,
   He has a bomb as an augmentation (Which is perfectly legal (For self defence))
   He thretens to use it
   Some of your friends in the kitchen go to talk to him while you continue to take orders (This is a normal occurence)
   He then detonates the bomb, killing everyone nearby and completely destroying your augmented arm and damaging your leg
   You begin to black out as you look at the giant crater in the ground, where the bomber and your friends were
   You are taken to the hospital
** At the hospital
   You awake attatched to machines, there is noone around as all of the doctors are automatic optimised robots
   The machines detach, and a robot comes over to you holding a new augmented arm,
   As the player, you can either choose to take the arm or decline it

   *Im not so sure about these ideas anymore*
    
   I think you should be judged based on your illegal augmentations
*** If you take it
    Your ability to use weapons will be much more powerful (You can two hand it)
    You can also move heavy objects 
    Later in the game, the government will access your augmented arm and make it malfunction against you occasionally,
    this will result in your arm electrifying you / hurting you
    Your opinion as someone against augmentations will not be taken seriously
   
    You can remove it at any time by going to an illegal augmentation shop (Expensive and you can get caught which will result in permenant reputation damage)
*** If you dont take it
    Your ability to use weapons will be less powerful
    You cannot move heavy objects
    The government cannot hack you
    Your opinion will be taken seriously
    (Need to think of more reasons not to take it as it is currently a disadvantage)
*** After choice
    You then leave the hospital and watch as people are shooting people and being taken into the hospital
    You watch as a shootout begins between a stop augmentations protest and criminals with augmentations
    You make your way to the stop augmentations headquarters
** Headquarters
   You find the headquarters beign shot up by augmented people
   You have to kill them to get into the headquaters
   This creates a moral dilema - was it worth it to kill all of those people
   You contemplate this for a moment before the leader comes up to you and thanks you
   You then tell the leader why you are there
   *If you have the augmented arm, you will not be taken seriously and will be turned away*
   If you dont have the arm:
      They will take you seriously and they will grant you access to the guild
      To prove that you are legitamete, you are sent on a mission to inspect the government headquarters
      They are not the main headquarters but neither you nor them know it yet
