* Story
** Start
   You begin at home watching the news
   On the news, there is a story that goes in depth about the increased suicide rates because of the augmentations
   This makes you reflect on you augmentations,
   As you need it for your job as a chef, you decide that you cannot get rid of it and the knife is incredibly helpful for safety (Crime ridden city)
** On the way to work
   You have to walk to work while observing augmented drug addics, crying children and vulnerable people
   You see a hit and run into a shop and are forced to jsut walk by it (Car only leaves once youre past it)
** At work
   You make it to the kitchen on time
   You converse with some friends and it is your turn to work at the counter taking orders
   You go to the counter and take some regular orders (1 or 2)
   It is a fancy resteraunt and you get payed a lot
   Suddenly, a scruffy augmented man walks in,
   He has a bomb as an augmentation (Which is perfectly legal (For self defence))
   He thretens to use it
   Some of your friends in the kitchen go to talk to him while you continue to take orders (This is a normal occurence)
   He then detonates the bomb, killing everyone nearby and completely destroying your augmented arm and damaging your leg
   You begin to black out as you look at the giant crater in the ground, where the bomber and your friends were
   You are taken to the hospital
** At the hospital
*** Note
    # You were originally going to have the choice whether to take the arm or not
    # If you took the arm, you wouldn't be taken seriously and the arm would
    # hurt you. I didn't feel like this fit the game so i removed it
*** Continuation
   You awake attatched to machines, there is noone around as all of the doctors are automatic optimised robots
*** Losing your arm
    You are told by a robotic voice that you lost your arm
    The player will then look at their arm (Or lack thereof)
*** Getting an augmented arm
    The machines detach, and a robot comes over to you holding a new augmented arm,
    You are forced to take the arm (Read Note for more)
*** Leaving the hospital
    The machines then detach and you then 


** Headquarters
   You find the headquarters beign shot up by augmented people
   You have to kill them to get into the headquaters
   This creates a moral dilema - was it worth it to kill all of those people
   You contemplate this for a moment before the leader comes up to you and thanks you
   You then tell the leader why you are there
