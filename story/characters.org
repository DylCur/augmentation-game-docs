* Characters 
** Basic ideas before making characters
   This is set in the future:
   - Any reference to realworld modern slang is immersion breaking and unrealistic
   
     All of the people in this game will have lived in inhumane conditions their whole life
   - They will be toughened and will have seen a lot of horrific things
     - This means that they will not cry throughout the game
       They are completely desensitised to everything they see
       The rebels are fighting so that people can stop dying, while they are desensitised to it,
       they still know that it is wrong and shouldnt be happening
       They are still upset when their family die
